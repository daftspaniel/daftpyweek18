You are Pythonista an adventurer in an 8bit style world. You start in
your safe village. Wander round to meet animals a people and perhaps
find something useful...

Use the WASD keys to move around. You can press the letter O to eat.
To start your adventure, find the stripey portal and walk thru it and
this will take you to the dungeon.

If you end up fighting a monster, press F to strike. If you die you will
return to the village. Find the diamond in the dungeon to get back home.
Collect 8 diamonds and go through the portal to reach the Dragon.

Good luck!
